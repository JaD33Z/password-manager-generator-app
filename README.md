Python project, a tkinter based gui app that generates, saves and stores passwords for different websites. passwords can also be searched and retrieved by the gui.

A very useful and fun to build project from an Angela Yu course. Tkinter is the library the gui is created from. Uses pyperclip to copy and send names and passwords within the app.
main.py is the main file containing all of the code for building this app.
