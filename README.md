Python project, a tkinter based gui app that generates, saves and stores passwords for different websites. passwords can also be searched and retrieved by the gui.

A very useful and fun to build project from an Angela Yu course. Tkinter is the library the gui is created from. Uses pyperclip to copy and send names and passwords within the app.
main.py is the main file containing all of the code for building this app. 

When run it should generate a json file with your data stored in there. Will also generate an .idea folder containing a couple xml files, for project settings. May depend on which IDE you are using(I believe, not certain about this though. Mine was made in Pycharm.)
Other files included are the background image, poetry.lock and pyproject.toml, are for package dependancies and settings.

- "lock file present, Poetry simply resolves all dependencies listed in your pyproject. toml file and downloads the latest version of their files. When Poetry has finished installing, it writes all of the packages and the exact versions of them that it downloaded to the poetry."

- Explained by Stack Overflow: "Project settings are stored with each specific project as a set of xml files under the .idea folder. If you specify the default project settings, these settings will be automatically used for each newly created project."
